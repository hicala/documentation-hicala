# Data Visualization Compilation

1. https://github.com/hicala/news-classifier

   News Classifier 

   ### Overview

   In this research project we took a political dataset (news.csv) from the 2016 US Presidential elections and created a machine learning model using Python to classify the news as REAL or FAKE. We implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit our model. Finally, we run an uncertainty evaluation of the model to obtain the level of accuracy.

   Data analytical review of the 911 Call incindents in 2016

   ### Overview

   In this research I am analyzing the 911 call dataset.

Tools: Python, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pyplot

Data Source: Kaggle.

The data contains the following fields( all are declared as a String variable):

    lat : Latitude
    lng: Longitude
    desc: Description of the Emergency
    zip: Zipcode
    title: Title
    timeStamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

   List of countries by nominal GDP 

   ### Overview

   This App is a result of my personal efforts to master the web scraping process using Python and BeatifuSoup. The document contains all the step by steps about how to scrape a Wikipedia page using Python3 and Beautiful Soup and finally exporting it to a CSV file.

   Exploring Contemporary Sea Piracy. Data extraction from a Live Piracy & Armed Robbery Report 

   ### Overview

   In this study the main goal is to evaluate the concentrations of the modern piracy incidents around the world. Modern-day pirates around the world share the legal designation of their historic brethren as “enemies of all mankind” because they disrupt and hinder the safe navigation of maritime vessels containing goods and people.

Piracy is a global crime which impedes the free movement of ships containing people and goods, with its attendant economic ramifications. The perpetrators are usually heavily armed, with sophisticated weapons to enable them to hijack a vessel or vessels and redirect them to their desired location for the payment of an expected ransom.

I am using Beautiful Soup for this Python app. Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing data out of HTML and XML files (aka webpages). It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

The major concept with Beautiful Soup is that it allows you to access elements of your page by following the CSS structures, such as grabbing all links, all headers, specific classes, or more. It is a powerful library. Once we grab elements, Python makes it easy to write the elements or relevant components of the elements into other files, such as a CSV, that can be stored in a database or opened in other software.

The data I used came from Live Piracy & Armed Robbery Report 2020. Reference: https://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php/piracy-reporting-centre/live-piracy-report

   Data extraction from a Atlanta Hawks Roster web site 

   ### Overview

   This study is part of a serie of statistical analysis in the composition and salary earned by main and key players in the NBA.

I am using Beautiful Soup for the this Python app. Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing data out of HTML and XML files (aka webpages). It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
