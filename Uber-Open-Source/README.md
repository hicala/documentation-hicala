# Uber Open Sourse

1. https://github.com/hicala/m3

   M3 monorepo - Distributed TSDB, Aggregator and Query Engine, Prometheus Sidecar, Graphite Compatible, Metrics Platform 

   ### Overview

   M3 is the obvious choice for Cloud Native companies looking to scale up their Prometheus based monitoring systems. M3 can be used as Prometheus Remote Storage and has 100% PromQL compatibility.

   M3 was originally developed at Uber in order to provide visibility into Uberâ€™s business operations, microservices and infrastructure. With its ability to horizontally scale with ease, M3 provides a single centralized storage solution for all monitoring use cases.

   Jaeger Operator for Kubernetes simplifies deploying and running Jaeger on Kubernetes. 

   ### Overview

   The Jaeger Operator is an implementation of a Kubernetes Operator.

1. https://github.com/hicala/baseweb

   A React Component library implementing the Base design language 

   ### Overview

   Base Web provides a robust suite of components out of the box. These include complex, ready to use components such as the Datepicker and low-level composable primitives, such as Layer.

For an overview of everything that we offer, check out the component gallery.

1. https://github.com/hicala/documentation

   Documentation/website for the Jaeger Distributed Tracing project. 

   ### Overview

   This repo houses all the assets used to build the Jaeger website, available at https://jaegertracing.io.

The site is built with Hugo and hosted by Netlify.

   Ludwig is a toolbox that allows to train and evaluate deep learning models without the need to write code. 

   ### Overview

   Ludwig is a toolbox that allows users to train and test deep learning models without the need to write code. It is built on top of TensorFlow.

To train a model you need to provide is a file containing your data, a list of columns to use as inputs, and a list of columns to use as outputs, Ludwig will do the rest. Simple commands can be used to train models both locally and in a distributed way, and to use them to predict new data.

A programmatic API is also available to use Ludwig from Python. A suite of visualization tools allows you to analyze models' training and test performance and to compare them.

Ludwig is built with extensibility principles in mind and is based on datatype abstractions, making it easy to add support for new datatypes as well as new model architectures.

   Deep universal probabilistic programming with Python and PyTorch 

   ### Overview

   Pyro is a flexible, scalable deep probabilistic programming library built on PyTorch. Notably, it was designed with these principles in mind:

    Universal: Pyro is a universal PPL - it can represent any computable probability distribution.
    Scalable: Pyro scales to large data sets with little overhead compared to hand-written code.
    Minimal: Pyro is agile and maintainable. It is implemented with a small core of powerful, composable abstractions.
    Flexible: Pyro aims for automation when you want it, control when you need it. This is accomplished through high-level abstractions to express generative and inference models, while allowing experts easy-access to customize inference.

Pyro was originally developed at Uber AI and is now actively maintained by community contributors, including a dedicated team at the Broad Institute. In 2019, Pyro became a project of the Linux Foundation, a neutral space for collaboration on open source software, open standards, open data, and open hardware.

For more information about the high level motivation for Pyro, check out our launch blog post. For additional blog posts, check out work on experimental design and time-to-event modeling in Pyro.
