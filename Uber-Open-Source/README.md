# Uber Open Sourse

1. https://github.com/hicala/m3

   M3 monorepo - Distributed TSDB, Aggregator and Query Engine, Prometheus Sidecar, Graphite Compatible, Metrics Platform 

   ### Overview

   M3 is the obvious choice for Cloud Native companies looking to scale up their Prometheus based monitoring systems. M3 can be used as Prometheus Remote Storage and has 100% PromQL compatibility.

   M3 was originally developed at Uber in order to provide visibility into Uberâ€™s business operations, microservices and infrastructure. With its ability to horizontally scale with ease, M3 provides a single centralized storage solution for all monitoring use cases.

   Ludwig is a toolbox that allows to train and evaluate deep learning models without the need to write code. 

   ### Overview

   Ludwig is a toolbox that allows users to train and test deep learning models without the need to write code. It is built on top of TensorFlow.

To train a model you need to provide is a file containing your data, a list of columns to use as inputs, and a list of columns to use as outputs, Ludwig will do the rest. Simple commands can be used to train models both locally and in a distributed way, and to use them to predict new data.

A programmatic API is also available to use Ludwig from Python. A suite of visualization tools allows you to analyze models' training and test performance and to compare them.

Ludwig is built with extensibility principles in mind and is based on datatype abstractions, making it easy to add support for new datatypes as well as new model architectures.
