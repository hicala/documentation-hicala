   A Smart, Automatic, Fast and Lightweight Web Scraper for Python

   ### Overview

   This project is made for automatic web scraping to make scraping easy. It gets a url or the html content of a web page and a list of sample data which  we want to scrape from that page. This data can be text, url or any html tag value of that page. It learns the scraping rules and returns the similar elements. Then you can use this learned object with new urls to get similar content or the exact same element of those new pages.

   ### Overview

   We used Beautiful Soup as the main tool. The major concept with Beautiful Soup is that it allows you to access elements of your page by following the CSS structures, such as grabbing all links, all headers, specific classes, or more. It is a powerful library.

Once we grab elements, Python makes it easy to write the elements or relevant components of the elements into other files, such as a CSV, that can be stored in a database or opened in other software.

   Data extraction from Coronavirus Update from COVID-19 Virus Pandemic - Worldometer web site 

   ### Overview

   I am using Beautiful Soup for the this Python app. Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing data out of HTML and XML files (aka webpages). It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

   Exploring Contemporary Sea Piracy. Data extraction from a Live Piracy & Armed Robbery Report 
   
   ### Overview

   In this study the main goal is to evaluate the concentrations of the modern piracy incidents around the world. Modern-day pirates around the world share the legal designation of their historic brethren as “enemies of all mankind” because they disrupt and hinder the safe navigation of maritime vessels containing goods and people.

Piracy is a global crime which impedes the free movement of ships containing people and goods, with its attendant economic ramifications. The perpetrators are usually heavily armed, with sophisticated weapons to enable them to hijack a vessel or vessels and redirect them to their desired location for the payment of an expected ransom.
