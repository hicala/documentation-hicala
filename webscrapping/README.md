   A Smart, Automatic, Fast and Lightweight Web Scraper for Python

   ### Overview

   This project is made for automatic web scraping to make scraping easy. It gets a url or the html content of a web page and a list of sample data which  we want to scrape from that page. This data can be text, url or any html tag value of that page. It learns the scraping rules and returns the similar elements. Then you can use this learned object with new urls to get similar content or the exact same element of those new pages.

   Data extraction from a US stats web site 

   ### Overview

   We used Beautiful Soup as the main tool. The major concept with Beautiful Soup is that it allows you to access elements of your page by following the CSS structures, such as grabbing all links, all headers, specific classes, or more. It is a powerful library.

Once we grab elements, Python makes it easy to write the elements or relevant components of the elements into other files, such as a CSV, that can be stored in a database or opened in other software.
