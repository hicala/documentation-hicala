1. https://github.com/hicala/news-classifier

   News Classifier 

   ### Overview

   In this research project we took a political dataset (news.csv) from the 2016 US Presidential elections and created a machine learning model using Python to classify the news as REAL or FAKE. We implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit our model. Finally, we run an uncertainty evaluation of the model to obtain the level of accuracy.

   Data analytical review of the 911 Call incindents in 2016

   ### Overview

   In this research I am analyzing the 911 call dataset.

Tools: Python, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pyplot

Data Source: Kaggle.

The data contains the following fields( all are declared as a String variable):

    lat : Latitude
    lng: Longitude
    desc: Description of the Emergency
    zip: Zipcode
    title: Title
    timeStamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
    twp: Township
    addr: Address
    e: Dummy variable (always 1)


1. https://github.com/hicala/gdp_python-data-mining

   List of countries by nominal GDP 

   ### Overview

   This App is a result of my personal efforts to master the web scraping process using Python and BeatifuSoup. The document contains all the step by steps about how to scrape a Wikipedia page using Python3 and Beautiful Soup and finally exporting it to a CSV file.

   1. https://github.com/hicala/piracy_reporting_centre_app

   Exploring Contemporary Sea Piracy. Data extraction from a Live Piracy & Armed Robbery Report 

   ### Overview

   In this study the main goal is to evaluate the concentrations of the modern piracy incidents around the world. Modern-day pirates around the world share the legal designation of their historic brethren as “enemies of all mankind” because they disrupt and hinder the safe navigation of maritime vessels containing goods and people.

Piracy is a global crime which impedes the free movement of ships containing people and goods, with its attendant economic ramifications. The perpetrators are usually heavily armed, with sophisticated weapons to enable them to hijack a vessel or vessels and redirect them to their desired location for the payment of an expected ransom.

I am using Beautiful Soup for this Python app. Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing data out of HTML and XML files (aka webpages). It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

The major concept with Beautiful Soup is that it allows you to access elements of your page by following the CSS structures, such as grabbing all links, all headers, specific classes, or more. It is a powerful library. Once we grab elements, Python makes it easy to write the elements or relevant components of the elements into other files, such as a CSV, that can be stored in a database or opened in other software.

The data I used came from Live Piracy & Armed Robbery Report 2020. Reference: https://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php/piracy-reporting-centre/live-piracy-report

1. https://github.com/hicala/nba_roster_analytic

   Data extraction from a Atlanta Hawks Roster web site 

   ### Overview

   This study is part of a serie of statistical analysis in the composition and salary earned by main and key players in the NBA.

I am using Beautiful Soup for the this Python app. Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing data out of HTML and XML files (aka webpages). It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

1. https://github.com/hicala/pyro

   Deep universal probabilistic programming with Python and PyTorch 

   ### Overview

   Pyro is a flexible, scalable deep probabilistic programming library built on PyTorch. Notably, it was designed with these principles in mind:

    Universal: Pyro is a universal PPL - it can represent any computable probability distribution.
    Scalable: Pyro scales to large data sets with little overhead compared to hand-written code.
    Minimal: Pyro is agile and maintainable. It is implemented with a small core of powerful, composable abstractions.
    Flexible: Pyro aims for automation when you want it, control when you need it. This is accomplished through high-level abstractions to express generative and inference models, while allowing experts easy-access to customize inference.

Pyro was originally developed at Uber AI and is now actively maintained by community contributors, including a dedicated team at the Broad Institute. In 2019, Pyro became a project of the Linux Foundation, a neutral space for collaboration on open source software, open standards, open data, and open hardware.

For more information about the high level motivation for Pyro, check out our launch blog post. For additional blog posts, check out work on experimental design and time-to-event modeling in Pyro.

1. https://github.com/hicala/cadence

   Cadence is a distributed, scalable, durable, and highly available orchestration engine to execute asynchronous long-running business logic in a scalable and resilient way. 

   ### Overview

   A large number of use cases span beyond a single request-reply, require tracking of a complex state, respond to asynchronous events, and communicate to external unreliable dependencies. The usual approach to building such applications is a hodgepodge of stateless services, databases, cron jobs, and queuing systems. This negatively impacts the developer productivity as most of the code is dedicated to plumbing, obscuring the actual business logic behind a myriad of low-level details. Such systems frequently have availability problems as it is hard to keep all the components healthy.

1. https://github.com/hicala/jaeger

   CNCF Jaeger, a Distributed Tracing Platform.

   ### Overview

   Jaeger, inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, is a distributed tracing platform created by Uber Technologies and donated to Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It can be used for monitoring microservices-based distributed systems:

    Distributed context propagation
    Distributed transaction monitoring
    Root cause analysis
    Service dependency analysis
    Performance / latency optimization

   Data Science Portfolio

   ### Overview

   Greetings, I am Hila (Hilario) Calderon.

I love using statistics and machine learning to solve and visualize practical analytics problems by incorporating predictive models. In summary, I am acting as a Data Translator and Data Interpreter to support the Insgiht storytelling from dissimile raw data sets. I'm also really into sailing, 360º video-photography, and 3D modelling, creative writing and teaching. I love sports between other hobbies as well, with the change of seasons.

This repository is containing a summary portfolio of some of data science projects completed by me during my professional career for government, academic, NGO, or for some self-taught, autodidactic, self-educated, self-instructed purposes.
